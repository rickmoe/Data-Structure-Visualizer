        An array stores multiple values or other data structures (called{" "}
        <em>elements</em>) next to each other. Each element of an array can be
        accessed and changed independent of the other indices. Individual
        elements can be selected by their <em>index</em> in the array, or their
        position in the array if you were to count starting at 0.
